# NYPD Crime Data Analysis: Project Overview (to be Updated)
The goal of this project is to clean
the data in a dataset, analyse it and generate a
descriptive summary. Also we have done some
data exploration with the dataset. The cleaned
data is used to generate a descriptive summary
for the features and contents. The dataset used
(NYPD Shooting Incidents Dataset) includes all
shooting crimes reported to the New York City
Police Department (NYPD) from 2006 to the
end of 2019.

### Execution Summary

### Data Cleaning of NYPD shooting data
Data cleaning is an important step in any Data science project. In this step, we will clean the dataset by applying following data cleaning methods
- Removing any duplicates present in the dataset.
- Converting the object data to categorical data to perform encoding in later stages.
- Dealing with missing values.
- Text cleaning of categorical feature names.
- Keeping only sensible Age ranges.
- Convert date and time to datatime64 datatype and split into different columns.
- Encoding categorical names with numerics.
- Removing any unnecessary columns.
