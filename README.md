# NYPD Crime Data Analysis: Project Overview 
The goal of this project is to clean
the data in a dataset, analyse it and generate a
descriptive summary. Also we have done some
data exploration with the dataset. The cleaned
data is used to generate a descriptive summary
for the features and contents. The dataset used
(NYPD Shooting Incidents Dataset) includes all
shooting crimes reported to the New York City
Police Department (NYPD) from 2006 to the
end of 2019.
### Data Cleaning of NYPD shooting data
Data cleaning is an important step in any Data science project.
